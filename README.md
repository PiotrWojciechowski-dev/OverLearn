# Introduction 
An Overwatch learning tool for map callouts to help achieve the same map knowledge as Contenderâ€™s teams and OWL teams. Web app being hosted on Firebase or Heroku will have two modes, a Training mode and a Challenge mode. Training mode will allow team members to practice map callouts with help enabled. The right answers will be displayed for 20 seconds which can be adjusted by the user. There is no timer on how fast you can complete the activity, but you will have a popup to help you by giving suggestions when you are taking too long to figure out a callout. Challenge mode will have no helper enabled. A user will be able to configure the difficulty from easy to hard, each difficulty having a set timer. A set of maps is picked at random. After each map competition you get a random amount of points depending on how fast the map was completed. Afterwards you can submit your score to a leader board which can be seen by the rest of the players and can be analysed by the team leader (not fully thought about yet). Registration will be handled using a built-in user system or using OAuth2 that authenticates users from the Discord API (most likely used in a more public environment). Team members will be able to save their configurations for later use. The app will try to make its features easy to edit and the navigation to be maneuverable.
